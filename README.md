# Worldle Scorer

## Description

A friend and I are engaged in an intense daily competition over the online geography games Worldle and Travle. I built this website to score our performances each day and decide on a winner.

## Features

Paste results in from the games and see the score totalled up. There is a test mode where anyone can try it out and see how their scores compare to ours. Copy and paste your score to send to and challenge others!

I use a custom scoring method to assign points to each Worldle, Travle and Countryle game.

Our results are stored in a MongoDB database.

## Future Features

A history section with analysis of past results

Improving the appearance

Possibly - Logins so others can play, compete and save their history. Although it's easy to falsify results as they are just pasted in from text.

## Technologies

Developed using React, Axios, Node on the backend and MongoDB
